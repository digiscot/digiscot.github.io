### Project description

The project will aim to increase digital inclusion within the visually impaired people of East Lothian ensuring they are able to play a part in the life of their communities. This will be achieved through very small classes consisting of the visually impaired person and their partner/carer and the tutor. The tutor in this case will be Jane McWhirter, Assitant Customer Service Officer in Wallyford Library. Jane is a qualified teacher with a natural passion and flair for ICT. 

The classes will be held in Wallyford Library when it is closed so Jane can give her full attention to her students. Wallyford has very good transport links to the rest of the county with a train station and frequent bus service. The 6 mini IPads bought from a previous bid will be used or if the student prefers they will use their own device. Jane has led a few classes previously and from experience knows that 2 people per class is sufficient and necessary for the most to be gained by participants. 

It is envisaged that classes will take place weekly and a session will last for 3 hours. Each student will receive 6 sessions in total or less dependent on need.

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* People with visual impairments are less isolated and better connected to their communities through digital technology
* East Lothian Council delivers better services to people with visual impairment across the county. So implementing the East Lothian Digital Inclusion and Participation Strategy
* East Lothian Library Service increases membership and issues of resources e.g. Books on CD, eaudio books
* Visually impaired people gain independence through use of online technology

### Evaluation
Due to unforeseen circumstances our first session did not begin until the 7th of March, 2 months behind schedule! However, Jane steamed ahead and started the second couple 2 weeks later on the 21st of March. This proved successful with the pairs learning from each other. Group 3 began sessions on the 9th of May and to date have had 5 weeks of tuition and will finish next week on the 20th of June. Next up are Mr and Mrs Young whose 6 weeks started on the 13th of June so they too will experience a slight roll over with the previous couple.
