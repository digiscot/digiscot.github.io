## Project plan

### Project description

CNS will work with elderly members of the Orkney and Shetland Community to teach them how to use digital technology through the use of the app Fieldtrip GB. People will be able to capture minor place-names and stories attached to specific places in the landscape. The data captured will be uploaded to a website, which will form a lasting legacy and which will also continuously be used to add more data. Participants will also be trained in scanning photographs and uploading other types of material to the project website.


## Project milestones 
Orkney

Milestone 1: Purchase of smart phones and printer/scanner. Advertise the workshop in The Orcadian. Match funding for staff time: Initial meeting with the Orkney Heritage Society on 22 April.

Develop questionnaire for EDINA app and test new smart phones.	Marketing using posters to promote our project to the local community in order to spread information about the project and our activities and will gain participants for our workshop and field days. This is all to ensure we are ready to start working on the project by the envisaged start date of May 25. Expected completion date: 25/5/15	

Milestone 2: Workshop held in late May/early June. Community work with participants for Alex Sanmark and Ragnhild Ljosland with data capturing and uploading material to the website.

## Evaluation

The project will be continuously evaluated. Participants will complete a questionnaire at the start and end of the project. 10% of the participants will also be interviewed.
